# BBOT Training Infrastructure

Your BBOT training infrastructure has been provisioned successfully. The public
IP of your EC2 instance is `{{ ansible_host }}`. You can connect to it via SSH 
using the following command:

$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/bbotTraining ubuntu@{{ ansible_host }}

An alias has been added to your local SSH config so you can run the following
command instead:

$ ssh bbot-ec2

You can move files to the EC2 instance using either of the following SCP
commands:

$ scp -i ~/.ssh/bbotTraining file.txt ubuntu@{{ ansible_host }}:~/
$ scp file.txt bbot-ec2:~/

Neo4J's web UI is running on port `7474`. You can access it using these
credentials:

 * Host: http://{{ ansible_host }}:7474/
 * User: neo4j
 * Pass: {{ lookup('password', 'tf/neo4j-pw.txt length=25 chars=ascii_letters,digits') }}

When training is complete, you can tear down the AWS infrastructure using this
command:

$ ~/.local/bin/terraform -chdir={{ tf }} destroy -var-file env.tfvars -state terraform.tfstate

Happy hunting!
